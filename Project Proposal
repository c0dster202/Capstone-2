Intro: I decided to pursue my second project idea and predict the likelihood of a flight being cancelled. 
I really like the data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and feel it will be a challenging project to complete!

Problem: Imagine your sister is having a big wedding out of town and you are flying there. An hour before take off, as you are in the airport, 
it is announced that the flight is cancelled after multiple delays. Without the foresight to plan ahead and have another option you may be completely out of luck.
Imagine, however, if when you booked the flight, you were provided with a warning. (“Due to inclimate weather, the chances of this flight being cancelled is 8%”).
Now, one will be able to plan ahead and prepare for a cancellation because it is at a greater likelihood.
There are many variables which can affect a flight being cancelled (weather, which airline it is, location, etc.)
and we will build a machine learning model using these factors to predict when a flight will be cancelled.

Who: Online travel agencies such as Expedia, Hotwire, TripAdvisor, SkyScanner, etc. would be able to significantly increase
the quality of their product with this. Even though it targets a narrow market, of flights that get cancelled, 
it is extremely valuable for the consequences and troubles it produces. These companies would love to have a tool like this they could use to show their customers. 

Data: Using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, I will predict the likelihood of a flight being cancelled.
As well I will use climate.gov to gain more data about weather for specific airports in the past to further improve my model.
