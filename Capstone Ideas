Capstone Project 2 Ideas

Using a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, I would like to attempt to predict whether or 
not a patient has diabetes based on the data. This data seems to have a lot of good variables that could be used in our predictions. 
Even though some of the variables have zero inputs (such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, and more) 
we understand this as a missing value that will have to be dealt with accordingly. I also can use visual graphs and plots to 
better understand the correlation of the data and easier deal with the missing values.

Using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, I want to predict the likelihood of a flight being cancelled. 
A lot of flights nowadays get delayed, for an hour or maybe even for longer than that. While this presents difficulties for people,
a flight getting cancelled all together is even worse. This makes airline companies look bad and their customers very upset.
If there were a way to predict when a flight was likely to be cancelled then people could be informed ahead of time and make plans accordingly.

I still would really enjoy working on an NFL/College football dataset to be able to predict when a player is worth trading up for in the draft.
This would be extremely difficult to do as not only are you trying to predict who will succeed in the draft,
but who is worth the capital you must give up in order to move up in the draft.
Therefore I would believe you need to also predict how much it would take to move up however many spots would be needed.
Obviously I am not choosing this one, but it is a crazy project idea.
